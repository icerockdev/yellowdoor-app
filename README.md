# Mobile Kotlin multiplatform project template with MOKO widgets

A sample project that helps to start building a Mobile Kotlin Multiplatform application. It establishes an architecture optimized for building cross-platform mobile applications through separation of concerns between the UI and business logic.

## Feature
- **Kotlin Multiplatform**'s motto is *Don't Repeat Yourself*. Share the business logic code written in Kotlin between Android and iOS apps. 100% native UI and performance (shared code compiles into native libraries);
- **Build from common code** – you can use only common code to create both Android and iOS apps;
- **Kotlin Gradle DSL** – Configure project with flexible Kotlin Gradle DSL;
- **Parallel build of modules** – Feature modules and the `domain` module don't depend on each other. This provides caching of build artifacts for each module and results in better compilation time;
- **Dependencies definition in buildSrc** - Simplify dependency management across modules;
- **Ready to use** - Template project includes all [moko libraries](https://moko.icerock.dev) and supports most common use cases:
  - Widgets - multiplatform UI;
  - ViewModels;
  - LiveData;
  - Resource management;
  - Runtime permissions access;
  - Media access;
  - UI lists management from shared code;
  - Network layer generation from OpenAPI.

## How to Run

Android - just open repository root directory in Android Studio and press `Run`.  
iOS - run `pod install` in directory `ios-app`. Then open `ios-app/ios-app.xcworkspace` and press `Run` on simulator/device.

## Project setup

### Setup your own ApplicationId

*Just like in other native apps*  
In `android-app/build.gradle.kts` change `org.example.app` in the following line:
```kotlin
applicationId = "org.example.app"
```
In Xcode project settings change `Bundle Identifier`.

### Setup your own project name

*Just like in other native apps*  
In `android-app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml` change value of `app_name`.  
In Xcode project settings change `Display name`.

### Setup your own app icon

*Just like in other native apps*  
Put your android icon to `android-app/src/main/res` and setup usage in `android-app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`.  
Put your iOS icon to `ios-app/src/Assets.xcassets/AppIcon.appiconset`.
